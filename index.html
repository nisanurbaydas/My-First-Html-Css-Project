                        Make a well in the centre and whisk in the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">egg. Whisk in the pumpkin puree until smooth.
                            Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan.
                            Pour 1⁄4 cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
                            Serve with your choice of topping.</span> </p>

                    <p class="contentText">You can use your favorite brand of hot dogs for this recipe. I typically use Hebrew National. You can also use other types of sausage, such as hot links or chicken apple sausage.This recipe will work with either popsicle sticks or candy sticks, whichever one you <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">have on hand.Use a thermometer to make sure that your oil is at the right temperature. If your oil is too hot, the corn dogs can burn. If the oil is too cold, the breading will absorb excess grease and be heavy.While this recipe is best when served right away, and leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Reheat the hot dogs in a 350 degrees F oven until warmed through and crispy.It’s important to make sure your hot dogs are completely dry before you dip them in batter. </span> </p>

                    <p class="contentText">Be sure to use pumpkin puree, and not canned pumpkin pie filling. The pie filling contains additional ingredients and will not work properly in this recipe.
                        Your cream cheese should be very soft to keep your batter from getting lumpy. Yo<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">u can microwave your cream cheese in 30 second increments to soften it quickly. You can swap out the graham cracker crust for a gingersnap crust for an additional nuance of spice flavor. It’s critical that your bars are fully chilled before you slice them to maintain the nice neat layers on the inside. I typically cut my cheesecake bars into 2 inch squares, but you can cut them larger or smaller depending on how many people you’re looking to serve. These bars can be made up to 3 days before you plan to serve them. Add the whipped cream and candy pumpkins right before serving. </span> </p>
